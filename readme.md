Welcome to our **Advent of Code 2025** repository! 

This is a shared space for our solutions. While the repo owner is focusing on **.NET 10**, other contributors are welcome to use whatever language they prefer.

## 📂 Repository Structure

We are organizing this repository by **User** first, then by **Day**. This ensures we don't step on each other's toes.
